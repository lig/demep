About
=====

demep - is Django Empty MongoEngine Project. It is just a template for starting new project using django, mongoengine and django-registration-me.


Usage
=====

1. Clone the template repository from https://github.com/lig/demep into some folder.
2. Run django-admin.py as usual but provide additional option `--template=TEMPLATE` where TEMPLATE is the path to the `project_template` folder from the folder where you have cloned this repository. Assuming you have cloned the repo into `/path/to/demep` your startproject command will look like `django-admin.py startproject --template=/path/to/demep/project_template`.
